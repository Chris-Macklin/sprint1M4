            <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds (/'li:nəs 'tɔ:rvɔ:ldz/ LEE-nəs TOR-vawldz,[2] Finland Swedish: ['li:nʉs 'tu:rvalds] ⓘ; born 28 December 1969) 
            is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and lead developer of the Linux kernel. He also created the distributed
            version control system Git.</p>

            <p>He was honored, along with Shinya Yamanaka, with the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology Academy Finland "in recognition 
            of his creation of a new open source operating system for computers leading to the widely used Linux kernel."[3] He is also the recipient of
            the 2014 IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award[4] and the 2018 IEEE Masaru Ibuka Consumer Electronics Award.[5]</p>

            </ol>
            <p>Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, the 28th December 1969, the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds,[6] the grandson of statistician
                Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds, and the great-grandson of journalist and soldier Toivo Karanko. His parents were campus radicals at the 
                University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. He was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel 
                Prize-winning American chemist, although in the book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution, he is quoted as saying, "I think I was 
                named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this made him "half Nobel Prize-winning chemist and half blanket-carrying 
                cartoon character".</p>
